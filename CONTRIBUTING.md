# Contributing to ngrok-go

Thank you for deciding to contribute to ngrok-go. The easiest way to contribute is to [open a new issue](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-go/issues/new) with clear repro steps when you find an issue with the library. We will triage and investigate these issues at a regular interval.
